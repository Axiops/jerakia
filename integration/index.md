# Integration 

The goal of Jerakia is to be a standalone data lookup tool that can be used by a variety of tools and technologies.  1.2 moved further towards this goal with the introduction of [Jerakia Server](/server) to enable tools written in any language to integrate with Jerakia and share the same data.

Currently there are several well documented ways of [integrating with Puppet](/integration/puppet) and also a [lookup plugin for Ansible](/integration/ansible). Please do let us know about any other integrations with other tools and we will review them here
