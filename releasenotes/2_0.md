# Jerakia Release Notes 2.0

## Summary

The main additions for 2.0 are the introduction of encryption as a first class citizen and integration with the _transit_ secret backend for vault to provide encryption.  We've also changed the API for datasources to make them easier to write.

2.0 removes some features, particularly around Puppet integration that are now available as a third party plugin rather than shipped in Jerakia core.  
## Features

* Introduced encryption as a first class citizen to Jerakia
* Encryption services are now pluggable with the default being Vault transit
* The output provider `:encryption` now uses whichever encryption provider has been configured
* API changes to data sources to make them more understandable
* Lookups can now be accepted without a key or a namespace, this is paving the way for data sources that can potentially be _keyless_ - eg: return all data in one query.
* The legacy Puppet data binding terminus and Hiera 3.x backend have been removed from core but are still available with the `jerakia-puppet` rubygem.
* Integration with Puppet 4.9+ is now via a Hiera 5 data provider function in the `crayfishx/jerakia` Puppet module
