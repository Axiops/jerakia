# Jerakia Release Notes 2.x

## 2.5.0

* Now available for more platforms on [pkgr](https://packager.io/gh/crayfishx/jerakia) including RHEL6
* Feature: Added consul datasource [link](https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/106)
* Feature: API now returns an additional field of `found`, this is useful for diferentiating between a value that is not found and a value that is explicitly set to null. [link](https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/107)
* Feature: Added `dig` output handler for returning subsets of returned data [link](https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/112)
* Feature: Added `lookup_key` flag to the HTTP datasource [link](https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/113)
* Bugfix: Datasource arguments were not processing defaults correctly, this is now fixed [link](https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/108)
* Bugfix: Docker image build failing with missing gem dependency, fixed. [link](https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/110)

## 2.4.0

* Feature: API now supports optional data encoding type of messagepack.  The default behaviour is still JSON as with previous versions, but now if you specify a content type of `application/x-msgpack` (and encode your payload with msgpack) then Jerakia will return responses in msgpack instead of JSON.  This has some small performance gains but also solves an issue with JSON encoding integer hash keys as strings (https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/issues/95).  This is currently an opt-in change, however we aim to make msgpack the default serialization format for Jerakia 3. Thanks to @hhenkel for the contribution (https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/96)

* Enhancement: Better error reporting and softer handling of situations where there is no logfile.  Jerakia will no longer cause an exception to be thrown if the logfile cannot be opened, instead it will direct logs to `STDOUT` with a warning to the user, and continue executing.  The previous behaviour was frustrating, especially when using the rubygem installation method that doesn't set up all the scaffolding for you.  Other errors such as failure to open the database files are also better reported and more understandable.  Any `Jerakia::Error` thrown on the CLI is now captured and reported back in an easier to understand way


## 2.3.0

* Enhancement:  Added `--bind`, `--port` and `--token_ttl` options to `jerakia server` to override these values from the CLI


## 2.2.0

* New feature: `config` CLI option to display current runtime configuration
* Fix: Better descrption of --verbose and --debug for server CLI options
* Fix: `plugindir` default of `/var/lib/jerakia/plugins` added
* Fix: More meaningful error message when a policy is not found, now throws a proper `Jerakia::PolicyError` exception

## 2.1.0

* Tighter permissions on logfile and configuration file when installing with system packages (https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/85)
* Bugfix: An issue in 2.0.0 meant that if you use `stop` with a `confine` or `exclude` statement in a lookup, that the lookup never actually gets invoked (https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/86)
* Fixed issues installing on Debian using apt (https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/83)
* Fixed HTTP datasource to be compatible with the new datasource API (https://github.com/crayfishx/jerakia/pull/82)
* Fixed validation of datasource parameters when nil and not mandatory

# 2.0.0

The main additions for 2.0 are the introduction of encryption as a first class citizen and integration with the _transit_ secret backend for vault to provide encryption.  We've also changed the API for datasources to make them easier to write.

### Summary

2.0 removes some features, particularly around Puppet integration that are now available as a third party plugin rather than shipped in Jerakia core.  

### Features

* Introduced encryption as a first class citizen to Jerakia
* Encryption services are now pluggable with the default being Vault transit
* The output provider `:encryption` now uses whichever encryption provider has been configured
* API changes to data sources to make them more understandable
* Lookups can now be accepted without a key or a namespace, this is paving the way for data sources that can potentially be _keyless_ - eg: return all data in one query.
* The legacy Puppet data binding terminus and Hiera 3.x backend have been removed from core but are still available with the `jerakia-puppet` rubygem.
* Integration with Puppet 4.9+ is now via a Hiera 5 data provider function in the `crayfishx/jerakia` Puppet module
