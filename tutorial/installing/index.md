# Quick start Tutorial
Please read through the basics first, as this will help to provide some background for terminology used in this tutorial.

## Installation

First we need to install Jerakia and it's dependencies using the Rubygem

{% highlight console %}
% gem install jerakia
{% endhighlight %}

Note: The tutorial guides you through some stuff that the [Forge Module](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/crayfishx/jerakia) would do for you.

Next: [Configuring Jerakia](/tutorial/config)
