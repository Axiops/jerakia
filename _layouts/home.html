<h1>Jerakia 1.2 Release</h1>

Jerakia is a pluggable hierarchical data lookup engine. It is not a database, Jerakia itself does not store any data but rather gives a single point of access to your data via a variety of back end data sources. Jerakia is inspired by Hiera, and can be used an additional backend or as a complete drop in replacement.

<p>Managing data can be a complex task.  With tools such as Puppet deployed   to configure your entire software stack across multiple locations and   environments, deciding on what configuration options and other site   specific data should be configured where becomes cumbersome within your   code.</p>
<p> Data separation refers to splitting out your site specific data   from your code.</p>
<p> You gain the ability to write and use generic modules   from the public domian without needing to modify them, and complex   conditional logic in your code to determine what configuration values   should be in a given environment is a thing of the past.</p>
